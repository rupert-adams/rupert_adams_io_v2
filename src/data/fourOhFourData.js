This page exists purely to let you know just how lost you are. And this paragraph exists purely to waste your time. Had you not have continued to read you could have already returned to the home page by now. You might have even closed the tab to my website. But instead you are here, ceaselessly searching for some greater meaning in the words. A meaning you shall never find. If you haven't given up yet I offer this one piece of advice: stop reading this. Honestly what are you still doing here? If I were you I would have a long hard think about how I spend my time. I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to do next, it honestly can't be as meaningless as your current task of reading some guy's 404 page. Did you know that you can lead a cow upstairs but you can't lead it down? You could learn lots of fun facts like this by doing literally anything else.",
