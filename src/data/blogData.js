            "The architect Keller Easterling, in a lecture on the subject of ‘Medium Design’ and how to think outside of the cultural norm, suggested that spacial designers should “offer to our allied disciplines some form of design activism, to actually manipulate the physical world and not just depict it.” It is becoming evident with the cascading global disasters: Covid-19, Climate catastrophe and geopolitical aggression among others that are an ever present aspect of our contemporary lives that we need to respond with a radical approach. One that not only deals with the crisis but also reinforces the defences against it. Keller goes on to examine how advertising for automated, electric cars can paint a picture of tranquility, and synergy with the natural space. Wherein the reality of a world filled with private autonomous vehicles in place of public transit options would just be a perpetually gridlocked set of ever-expanding roads (See Los Angeles). I would like to borrow Easterling's idea of committing to designing for action over theory. It is from here that I outline the principles I will use in order to design for a better world, what I will call Radical Egalitarian System Design.",
            "The current drive towards individualised solutions and responses that started with the 1970’s neoliberal ideal has left some substantial scars on the planet and has proven to all but crumble in the face of the disasters it has instigated. It is easy to feel hopeless as an individual when faced with a systemic crisis, when the institutions and systems who not only caused it but hold the power to change course continue to do nothing, or worse, compound the issue. But the situation is never without hope. As the late academic Raymond Williams wrote: “To be truly radical is to make hope possible rather than despair convincing”.",
            "Against this backdrop I have set out 6 principles for what I call Radical Egalitarian System Design, a practice for transformational development in online, offline, commercial and community-based projects. As Benjamin Peters’s concludes in his book ‘How not to network a nation’: “Networks are not the application of a theory, nor are they the children of hard gadgetry or pragmatic engineering. They are the technical arrangements of social relations that have and will continue to change the world”.  So without further ado, here are my design principles:",
            "1.) Care over Control. In every aspect of design and maintenance, care is preferable over control. The Care Collective’s manifesto describes care as ‘a social capacity and activity involving the nurturing of all that is necessary for the welfare and flourishing of life. Above all, to put care centre stage means recognising and embracing our interdependencies’. Longevity and fairness in any system both require a continuous level of care and fostering a structure in such a way can allow a system of interdependencies to flourish.",
            "2.) Natively Democratic. Neoliberal markets are built top-down, and in many ways lock the majority out of any decision-making when it comes to the structures they must interact with. In every way possible the people who use the system must have the ability to drive its present and future. Whether through direct democracy, a representative council framework or any other number of creative democratic approaches, interacting with the system necessitates a say in what the system is.",
            "3.) Regenerative in Totality. Profit-driven, competitive markets have wrecked the natural world and our interaction with ecological networks. The decades of content growth have unleashed forces that are destroying lives and causing massive displacements across the globe. As this catastrophe has become harder to hide, a sudden move towards ‘greener’ and ‘net-zero’ market movements has begun, a lot of it greenwashing the issues and not addressing the root causes of this disaster. The system must go beyond sustainable, it must be regenerative. In every way possible it must not only avoid damaging the planet or people further, but actively work towards building back what has been taken, either with re-growth of ecological spaces, money spent towards such ventures or giving back to any community that has suffered at the hands of the systems that came before it.",
            "4.) Distributed over Decentralised over Centralised. Historically there have been three blueprint design blueprints for networks: Distributed, Decentralised and Centralised. The design of a system is, of course, dependant on a great number of things. When designing a system that has egalitarian principles in mind, distributed systems are preferable to decentralised, which are preferable to centralised. A distributed system can offer a robust and fair structure, where power is shared through the framework. A distributed system can resist any breaks or issues in one node and rebuild from a number of directions. A decentralised system can allow for democratic dialogue in present and future affairs, checking the power of the decision-making. A centralised system can be a strong choice to hold ground against outside threats or issues but can quickly lose its democratic structure. Again the choice depends on what the system is built for, but the more egalitarian and democratic, the better an egalitarian system will flourish.",
            "5.) Modular Gestalt Components. Kurt Koffka, one of the three German philosophers who created the gestalt principles of psychology summed up the idea in the simple phrase: “The whole is other than the sum of its parts”. Modern technology in particular has moved towards a single-use, ‘replace quickly’ mentality that supplements the capitalist drive towards constant growth. Wireless earphones are quickly becoming a material nightmare for the planet as the glued-in and un-replaceable batteries render them obsolete within a year or two of use. If the whole is different than the sum of its parts, the parts must be modular and replaceable. Either directly substituted or improved upon, with the old components leaving as little waste as possible. Replace, reuse recycle first, but also build the system so that any area that doesn’t work or serve its purpose can be lifted and replaced with minimal interference to the whole.",
            "6.) As Above, So Below. The final principle is an extension of all the others. The overarching idea is that no part of the system should be left behind, whether that is the people who use it or components that make it. Our current societal structures often cut funding and infrastructure from the most vulnerable and ‘in-need’ areas in favour of the strongest or most profitable. This serves to weaken the whole structure through structural inequality and stagnation. A system that improves and grows must be inclusive and bring everyone with it. It is not about where we came from. But where we go together.",
            "The revolutionary thinker Rosa Luxemburg once said “Before a revolution happens, it is perceived as impossible; after it happens it is perceived as inevitable”. What we are facing requires urgent attention but the situation have never been better to turn theory into practice; transforming the world for the betterment of everyone. I hope the simple principles I have laid out here can help to create a structure towards the co-operative, inclusionary future that is ahead of us."
